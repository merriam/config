This is a collection of configuration scripts for bash on Linux.  

I use it to keep handy aliases, history handling, git sources, etc. in one place.  This 
allows me to work across machines quickly. 

Typically, I will symlink the affected files to a subdirectory, e.g., 
   ~$ git clone http://github.com/merriam/config.git linux_config
   ~$ rm .bashrc; ln -s linux_config/.bashrc .
   and so on for each config file.

   I also have the make_links.sh file that does these commands for me in a hurry.
